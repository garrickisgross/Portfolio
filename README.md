**1. How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program?**

To interpret user needs and implement them into a program, start by gathering detailed information about what users need and why. This helps you understand their objectives and the issues they face. By framing requirements through their perspectives, you can prioritize features and build solutions that align with their expectations and make a tangible impact.

**2. How does creating “user stories” help with this?**

Creating “user stories” helps because it frames each feature from the user’s perspective—focusing on what the user wants to achieve and why it’s valuable to them. This approach ensures development stays centered on real-world goals, making it easier to prioritize tasks and deliver meaningful results.

**3. How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?**

When developing programs, Agile processes like regular sprint planning, incremental development, and retrospectives are essential. These practices allow for continuous feedback and help you quickly adapt to changing requirements. Incorporating these Agile methods in future work will help improve flexibility and enhance user-focused development.

**4. What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?**

Being a good team member in software development means collaborating openly, respecting different perspectives, and contributing to a positive work environment. Supporting teammates, providing constructive feedback, and actively participating in Agile ceremonies like stand-ups and retrospectives are key to building trust and keeping everyone aligned with the team’s shared goals.
